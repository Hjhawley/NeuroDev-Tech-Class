        <h3>Course Overview</h3>
        <p>
          This beginner-level course introduces students to the essentials of
          web design and development, focusing on frontend creation with HTML
          and CSS. Students will learn about the infrastructure of the Internet,
          how to build and publish web pages, and employ various layout and
          styling techniques.

        <h3>"Web Design" vs. "Web Development"</h3>
        <p>
          A <b>web designer</b> focuses on the visual aspects of a website:
          layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance. They create mockups to
          make sure the site is visually appealing and user-friendly, using
          tools like Photoshop and design frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <b>web developer</b>, on the other hand, focuses on the technical
          side: building the website using code like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          Developers take the designer's mockups and turn them into a
          functional, working website.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this course, you'll be learning web development: how to write code
          that makes websites work and look the way they're supposed to. While
          we'll cover how to style a site, we won't get into graphic design
          principles. My focus is on teaching you how to build and style
          functional web pages, so don't worry if you're not an artist!
        </p>
        <p>
          While we're at it, don't worry if you don't consider yourself a
          programmer. Coding websites, especially with HTML and CSS, is very
          different from traditional programming (using languages like Python or
          C++). HTML structures web content, and CSS styles it. Neither involves
          complex logic or algorithms, making web development a great starting
          point for anyone learning to code.
