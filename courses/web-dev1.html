            <h3>"Web Design" vs. "Web Development"</h3>
            <p>
                A <b>web designer</b> focuses on the visual aspects of a website: layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance. 
                They create mockups to make sure the site is visually appealing and user-friendly, using tools like Photoshop and design frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
                A <b>web developer</b>, on the other hand, focuses on the technical side: building the website using code like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                Developers take the designer's mockups and turn them into a functional, working website.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this course, you'll be learning web development: how to write code that makes websites work and look the way they're supposed to. 
                While we'll cover how to style a site, we won't get into graphic design principles. 
                My focus is on teaching you how to build and style functional web pages, so don't worry if you're not an artist!
            </p>
            <p>
                While we're at it, don't worry if you don't consider yourself a programmer.
                Coding websites, especially with HTML and CSS, is very different from traditional programming (using languages like Python or C++). 
                HTML structures web content, and CSS styles it. Neither involves complex logic or algorithms, making web development a great starting point for anyone learning to code.
