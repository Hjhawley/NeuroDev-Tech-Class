        <h1>Python II - Object-Oriented Programming</h1>

        <!-- Course Overview -->
        <section>
            <h3>Course Overview</h3>
            <p>
                This intermediate course dives into object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, GUI development, and 
                modular programming with Python. Students will learn about recursion, generators, decorators, and third-party libraries, 
                culminating in a project where students develop a GUI-based chess game using PyGame.
            </p>
