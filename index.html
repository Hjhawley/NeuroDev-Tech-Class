        Whether you're looking to build your basic computer skills for college
        and career success, or you're already tech-savvy and want to take your

        build your résumé, and gain real-world confidence with every course.

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>
        Students are strongly encouraged to start with our
        <a href="courses/digital-literacy.html">Digital Literacy</a> course. It
        covers basic computer skills that will provide a good foundation for any
        course moving forward, and it also gives us helpful information about
        your current capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, if you consider yourself to be confidently tech-savvy you are
        welcome to skip the readings and test out of the course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Course materials are password-protected. Ask your tech coach or a mentor
        if you need the password.
      </p>

      <h2>Navigating Courses</h2>
      <p>
        Courses can be found on our <a href="catalog.html">Course Catalog</a> page.
        Each course typically includes three units of material. Unit assignments
        include readings, videos, and activities to help you learn. As you
        complete each course unit, you can check the boxes next to each task to
        mark them as complete and track your progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each unit typically ends with a test or a project to assess your
        understanding. The exact expectation will vary based on individual skill
        levels, but a passing score is usually 90% or higher. Tests are
        open-note, and we are happy to offer any accommodations you may need.
        Don't stress!
      </p>
      <p>
        When you finish a unit, let your tech coach know so they can grade your
        work. You're welcome to continue on to the next unit in the meantime.
      </p>

      <h2>Earning Certifications</h2>
      <p>
        Upon successfully completing each unit in a course, you'll receive an
        official NeuroDev certification. Certificates are awarded at tech
        ceremonies held every few months and represent all of your hard work.
      </p>
      <p>
        These certifications demonstrate valuable skills that you can showcase
        on your resume or job applications. Keep your certificates somewhere
        safe!
      </p>
