        <h1>How to Use This Website</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our tech class website! This guide will help you understand how to navigate the site and complete your tech certifications.</p>

        <h2>Navigating Courses</h2>
        <p>Each course contains a detailed overview, objectives, and usually three units of learning material. Unit assignments includes readings, videos, and activities to help you learn the material.</p>

        <h2>Completing Assignments</h2>
        <p>As you complete the course material, you can check the boxes next to each task to mark them as complete. This helps you track your progress through the course.</p>
        <p>Each unit usually ends with a test or a project meant to assess your understanding of the material. Expetations will vary depending on student's current abilities, but typically you'll need a score of 90% or higher to pass the unit.</p>
        <p>When you complete a unit, let your tech coach know so they can grade your work. Feel free to move on to the next unit in the meantime.</p>

        <h2>Getting Certified</h2>
        <p>Upon successfulyl completing of all units and passing the final tests, you will receive a certification from NeuroDev, showcasing your achievement.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions, please reach out to your teach coach.</p>
