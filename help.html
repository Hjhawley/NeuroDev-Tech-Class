        <h1>How to Use This Website</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the NeuroDev Tech Class website! This guide will help you navigate the site and earn your tech certifications.</p>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>Students are strongly encouraged to start with the Digital Literacy course. It covers skills that will give you a good foundation for any course moving forward, and it also gives us helpful information about your current abilities.</p>
        <p>That said, if you're feeling confident about your tech savviness, you are welcome to skip the readings and take the test right away.</p>
        <p>Course materials are password-protected. Ask your tech coach or a mentor if you need the password.</p>

        <h2>Navigating Courses</h2>
        <p>Each course typically includes three units of material. Unit assignments include readings, videos, and activities to help you learn.</p>
        <p>As you complete each course unit, you can check the boxes next to each task to mark them as complete. This helps you track your progress.</p>
        <p>Each unit typically ends with a test or a project to assess your understanding. The exact expectation may vary based on individual skill levels, but a passing score is usually 90% or higher. Tests are open-note, and we are happy to offer any accommodations you might need. Don't stress!</p>
        <p>When you finish a unit, let your tech coach know so they can grade your work. You're welcome to continue on to the next unit in the meantime.</p>

        <h2>Earning Certifications</h2>
        <p>Upon successfully completing each unit in a course, you'll receive an official NeuroDev certification. Certificates are awarded at tech ceremonies held every few months and represent all of your hard work.</p>
        <p>These certifications demonstrate valuable skills that you can showcase on your resume or job applications. Keep your certificates somewhere safe!</p>
